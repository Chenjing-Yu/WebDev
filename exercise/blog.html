        <p class="extract">Back to study, the subjects just delivered the first assignments this week, and suddenly I got the feeling of getting involved in studies. I love this feeling and I'll keep working hard on the staff that I really like.</p>
        <p>This week I attended a club meeting which is more about ice-breaking activities, just as its name "trivia", than the club itself and found out that it's hard to really take a part in such activities with local people. I think it's because I'm from a totally different background-there's not much to talk about when it comes to daily life. I tried to talk, but failed. I really felt awkward and frustrated.</p>
        <p>Then I started to think about what I'm going to do with this club, doubting that whether I can really do something helpful and have fun making friends at the same time, or just focus on doing something without talking to people? How sad! Anyway, I'll give it more tries.</p>
